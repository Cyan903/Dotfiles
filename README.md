# Dotfiles

Pretty much my linux system in a nutshell. I'm using Manjaro as of `2021/09/12`.

## Setup
Most of these files expect `~/Pictures/Static` to exist along with `~/Dev/Scripts`.
- Place everything in `images/icons` in `~/Pictures/Static`.
- Place everything in `scripts` in `~/Dev/Scripts`.

Programs I'm using (these aren't required to be installed, just change `awesome/config/user/src/programs.lua` if you want to use your own).
- xrandr
- nitrogen
- picom ([github.com/jonaburg/picom](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom))
- blueman
- pulseaudio
- lxsession

These are the programs that make up the theme.
- AwesomeWM
- Dunst
- Kitty
- Neofetch
- Rofi
- [Firefox](https://github.com/CyanPiano/Firefox-theme)
