# AwesomeWM Config

I've split and modified the original `rc.lua` file into seperate directories with the goal of making editing this config later easier.

Here is a brief description of what they do.

- **/user/src** - Genearal user settings.
  - **/programs** - Edit programs that start on launch.
  - **/shortcuts** - Edit keybindings.
  - **/styles** - Edit basic styles such as border color/width.
- **/resources** - Files and images used by the theme.
- **/ext** - External widgets and programs created by other people. Credits are included within the folders.
- **/components** - Components used throughout the theme such as the taskbar. 
- **/awesome** - General awesome settings such as window rules or error handling.
